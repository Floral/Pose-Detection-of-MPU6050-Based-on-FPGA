It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net U_DATA_PACKING_0/state_next__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_DATA_PACKING_0/state_next_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U_DATA_PACKING_0/state_next_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
